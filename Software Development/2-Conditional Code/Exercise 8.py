"""
Odd or Even?
The following program is supposed to ask for a number and tell if the value is odd or even. However, the code doesn't work. Can you fix it?
"""

#odd or even
# number = 3
# result = "unknown"

# if number % 2 = 0:
#     result = "even"
# else:
#     result = "odd"

#odd or even
number = 3
result = "unknown"

if number % 2 == 0:
    result = "even"
else:
    result = "odd"
