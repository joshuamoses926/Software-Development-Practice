You're buying a $20,000 car in California, where sales tax is 7.25%. The following program calculates the total cost of the car, including sales tax. However, the program doesn't work. Can you fix it?
"""

# car_price = $20,000
# tax = 7.25
# total_price = car_price * (1 + tax/100)
# print(total_price)

car_price = 20000
tax = 7.25
total_price = car_price * (1 + tax/100)
print(total_price)
