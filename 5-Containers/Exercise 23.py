Phone Book Lookup
In this exercise, you're tasked with helping a developer who's trying to build a simple phone book application.
However, he seems to be having trouble retrieving values from the dictionary representing the phone book. He's trying to retrieve John's phone number, but his code throws an error. Can you spot and fix the issue?
"""

#phone_book = {"John": "555-123", "Mary": "555-456", "Jane": "555-789"}
#print(phone_book[John])

phone_book = {"John": "555-123", "Mary": "555-456", "Jane": "555-789"}
print(phone_book["John"])
