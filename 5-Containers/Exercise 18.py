The following program attempts to create a list of numbers from 1 to 5 and print the first and last elements. However, it's not working as expected. Can you spot the issues and fix it?
"""

# numbers = [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
 
# Print the first and last elements
# print(f"First element: {numbers[1]}")
# print(f"Last element: {numbers[5]}")


# List of numbers
numbers = list()
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Print the first and last elements
print(f"First element: {numbers[0]}")
print(f"Last element: {numbers[4]}")
